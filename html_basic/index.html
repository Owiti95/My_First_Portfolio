    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is [Your Name]. This is my very first webpage, and I’m
      excited to start learning web development!
    </p>

    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>
      I began learning HTML and CSS recently, and I’m enjoying the process of
      building websites from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day, I practice writing more code and exploring how to design pages
      that look great and function well.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to create projects that showcase my growth as a developer and
      help me build a solid portfolio.
    </p>
